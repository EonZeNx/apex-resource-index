# Patterns
Directory of `.hexpat` files describing the shape of a file.

### Guide
Install [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex).
Clone this repo.
Open ImHex > Extras > Settings > Folders.
Add folder > Select the **`formats` folder** (NOT the `patterns` folder).
Drag a supported file into the ImHex window, and after a second a pop-up will ask which pattern to apply.
