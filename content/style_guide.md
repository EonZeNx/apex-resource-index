File names should be brief and ideally unique to make internal links less of a headache. As file names are used to build the page path, follow snake-case rules (a-z0-9_)

> [!tip]
> For this same reason, set Obsidian to use absolute links rather than shortest. There are several files with the same name

All pages should have at least a title and tags, and it's highly recommended to also have a description
Title should be short, descriptive, and correctly capitalised
Tags should include the type first, with the remaining tags listed by importance.
Other tags include `game/ABREVIATION`, `knowledge/LEVEL`, and `author/NAME`
Tags should be in snake-case (all lower case, underscores instead of spaces)

> [!tip]
> Tags are used to perform simple searching to advanced filtering, use them correctly

Non-markdown files are located in the `assets` directory, and must always have unique names.
Technically there is no file size limit but keep it sane; ensure the file size is small
